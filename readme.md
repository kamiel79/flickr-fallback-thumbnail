Automatically grab a fallback featured image if your post doesn't have one!

## Description

Adding explicing thumbnails (featured images) to your content takes time. Even if you don't add your own photography, you'd still need to go to search.creativecommons.org or so.
This plugin hooks into the thumbnail URL and changes this with an image from the Flickr API, based on the tags in your post. If Flickr couldn't find anything, it will return nothing.
I have achieved amazing results, with posts that all of a sudden had a very adequate thumbnail.

[Flickr images might have licensing issues, so I recommend to use this plugin only on personal sites]

## Installation

Unzip the plugin in your plugin directory. Edit the file flickr-fallback-thumbnails.php. Look for the line var $api_key = "your_api_key" and fill in your API-key.
